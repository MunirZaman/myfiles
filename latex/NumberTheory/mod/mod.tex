\section{Linear Congruences}

\begin{theorem}
    The linear congruence $ax \equiv b \pmod{n}$ has a solution if and only if $d\mid b$ 
    where $d=\gcd(a,n)$. Moreover the equation will have $d$ incongruent solutions modulo $n$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    $ax \equiv b \pmod{n}$ implies that there exists an integer $y$ such that 
    $ax - b = ny \implies ax - ny = b$. We already know that the equation $ax -ny = b$ 
    will have a solution if and only if $\gcd(a, n)\mid b$. \\
    Now let us show that the equation will have $d$ incongruent solutions modulo $n$. 
    We know that if $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ is a solution of $ax -ny = b$ then every other solution 
    of the equation will be of the form
    \[
        x = x_{0} + \frac{n}{d} t \quad y = y_{0} + \frac{a}{d} t
    \]
    where $t$ is some integer. Now let us consider the solutions when $0 \leq t \leq d-1$. 
    We claim that these are all of the incongruent solutions modulo $n$. \\
    We will first show that if $0\leq t_{1} < t_{2}\leq n-1$ are two distinct integers then 
    the two solutions $x_{0} + \frac{n}{d} t_{1}$ and $x_{0} + \frac{n}{d} t_{2}$ must be 
    incongruent modulo $n$. Suppose that the two solutions are congruent then
    \begin{align*}
                 & x_{0} + \frac{n}{d} t_{1} \equiv x_{0} + \frac{n}{d} t_{2} \pmod{n} \\
        \implies & \frac{n}{d} t_{1} \equiv \frac{n}{d} t_{2} \pmod{n}
    \end{align*}
    Now since $\gcd(n/d, n) = n/d$ we get
    \[
        t_{1} \equiv t_{2} \pmod{d} \implies d \mid t_{2} - t_{1} 
    \]
    But $d \mid t_{2} - t_{1} \implies d \leq t_{2} - t_{1}$ which is impossible because 
    $t_{2} - t_{1} < d$. Therefore the solutions for which $0 \leq t \leq d-1$ must be incongruent 
    modulo $n$. \\
    Now it remains to show that any other solution $x_{0} + \frac{n}{d} t$ is congruent to 
    one of the $d$ solutions for which $0 \leq t \leq d-1$. From the division algorithm we 
    know that there exists integers $q$ and $t'$ where $0 \leq t' \leq d-1$ such that 
    $t = dq + t'$. Now,
    \begin{align*}
        x_{0} + \frac{n}{d} t & \equiv x_{0} + \frac{n}{d} (dq + t') \pmod{n} \\
                              & \equiv x_{0} + \frac{n}{d} \times dq + \frac{n}{d} \times t' \pmod{n} \\
                              & \equiv x_{0} + \frac{n}{d} t' \pmod{n}
    \end{align*}
    We are done!
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
    If $a$ and $n$ are coprime integers, that is $\gcd(a, n)=1$, then the linear congruence 
    $ax \equiv b \pmod{n}$ where $b$ is some integer has a unique solution modulo $n$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{example}
    Find all incongruent solutions of the linear congruence $36x \equiv 8 \pmod{102}$
\end{example}
\begin{sol}
    Since $\gcd(36, 102) = 6$ and $6 \nmid 8$, there does not exist any solution to this 
    linear congruence.
\end{sol}
