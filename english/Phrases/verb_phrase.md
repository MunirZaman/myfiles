# Verb Phrases

A Verb Phrase is a phrase headed by a verb. Most verb phrases consist of a verb and its complement. \
\hrule
**Complement:** *A complement is whatever is required by a particular verb to make a complete sentence.* \
\hrule
For example: 

* She saw *the accident*

In the above example sentence *the accident* is the complement of the verb *saw*. If we delete the complement *the accident* 
we either get a totally ungrammatical sentence or a new, unrelated sentence that does not mean the same thing as the original.
    
* She saw

In traditional grammar there are two types of verb: *action verbs* and *linking verbs*.

1. Action Verbs
    * He **went** to the market
    * He **has** a car 
    * Jane **wrote** a novel

2. Linking Verbs
    * He **looks** happy
    * The food **looks** delicious
    * The novel **became** a bestseller

# Linking Verbs
A Linking verb links the complement back to the subject. That is, the complement of the linking verb describes or refers back to 
the subject. For example:

* Donald **is** *funny*
* Jane **looks** *happy*
* He **is** *the captain*

Sometimes linking verbs are compared to equal signs. That is, we can replace a linking verb with an equal sign.

* Donald = *funny*
* Jane = *happy*
* He = *the captain*

The complements of linking verbs are called *Subject Complements*. The term subject complement comes from the fact that the 
complements of linking verbs must refer back to and describe the subjects. \
The two most common types of subject complements are Noun Phrases called *Predicate Nominatives* and 
Adjectives called *Predicate Adjectives*. For example:

* He **is** *the captain*. (*Predicate Nominative*)
* Jane **looks** *happy*. (*Predicate Adjective*)

More examples of linking verbs(**bold**):

* The kittens soon **grew** *strong*.
* His face **turned** *red*.
* I **feel** *sick*.
* The cake **tasted** *stale*.
* Larry **looked** *pleased with himself*.

# Action Verbs

An action verb is a verb that is not a linking verb. Action verbs that have complements are called *Transitive Verbs* and action 
verbs that do not have complements are called *Intransitive Verbs*. For example:

1. Transitive Verbs:
    * Simon **met** *a pie-man*.
    * Simon **bought** *a pie*.

2. Intransitive Verbs:
    * She **snores**.
    * They **laughed** at her.

Notice in the sentence *They laughed at her*, the verb *laugh* is an intransitive verb because *at her* is not a complement of 
*laugh*. *at her* is a *prepositional phrase*(*preposition* + *noun phrase*). \
\hrule
**Object:** *By far the most frequent complement of a transitive verb is a noun phrase. The noun phrase complement of 
an action verb is called an object.* \
\hrule
For example:

* Simon really **liked** *the pie*. (*the pie* is the object of the verb **liked**)

Sometimes transitive verbs have two objects. These objects are called *Indirect Objects* and *Direct Objects*. 
When there are two objects, the indirect object always occurs before the direct object. For example:

* Sally gave *the boss* **(IO)** *her report* **(DO)**
* Tom got *the kids* **(IO)** *some pizza* **(DO)**.
